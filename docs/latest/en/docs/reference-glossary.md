## C

##### Cloud (computing):
Cloud (computing) is the generic name of internet-based computing services for computers and other devices that provide computing resources that can be used at any time and shared among users. (See Wikipedia)

##### Convention:
It refers to a way in which something is usually done.

## L

##### Low-Code:
It is expressed as "writing little or no-code ...".

##### Low-Code Platform:
They are software platforms that can add new features without writing code or with writing very little code.

## M

##### Model:
It is the generic name for simplified examples to perform operations on a real-world asset, event, or system. Models on Pyronome express the definitions formed by the main and sub-elements of the software system to be developed.

##### Modo:
It is a modeling language that is used for defining model elements on Pyronome (See http://modolanguage.org).

## O

##### Organization:
An organization is a record defined to create namespaces for developed patterns. With the help of organizations, different pattern directories can be created, which can be accessed through the domain name [https://pyronome.com](https://pyronome.com).

## P

##### Pattern:
Pyronome has an architecture that supports the conversion of software elements (e.g., snippets, code blocks, libraries, packages, etc.) into reusable components. These reusable components are called "Pattern"s.

##### Project:
It is the main element that contains the definitions that yield the generated source code on Pyronome.

## R

##### Real-Life System:
It refers to holistic systems that include human, machine, law, policy, and rules. "Real Life Systems" is also referred to as social systems.

## S

##### Schema:
Patterns need specific features and parameters to be added by the user when generating source code. Schemas are elements that enable the information to be taken from the user to be defined.

##### Social System:
It refers to holistic systems that include human, machine, law, policy, and rules. "Social Systems" is also referred to as real-life systems.

##### Source Code:
In computing, source code is any collection of code, possibly with comments, written using[1] a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code that can be executed by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed. (See Wikipedia)

## T

##### Template:
One of the essential components of a pattern is the template. Templates enable the creation of generators by bringing together the pieces of code according to the model tree.
