The catalog that lists the patterns that we can install to our projects is called **"Marketplace"**. All patterns on the Marketplace are classified and listed according to specific criteria.

Description about **"Popular"** filters used for patterns are as follows:

| Filter Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Free | This filter lists **FREE** patterns. |
| Stable | This filter lists the patterns that have at least one **"Stable"** version. |
| Official | This filter lists the patterns developed by Pyronome. |
| Certified | This filter lists the patterns developed by users with Professional, Business, and Enterprise membership subscriptions. Certified patterns must have at least one stable version, and must be **approved** by Pyronome editors. |
| Certified Enterprise | This filter lists the patterns developed by users with Business and Enterprise membership subscriptions. Certified Enterprise patterns must have at least one stable version, and must be **approved** by Pyronome editors. |

The tags owned by the pattern affect display order in the lists and search results.
