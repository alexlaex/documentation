You can use organizations to create generic namespaces, for developed patterns on [https://pyronome.com](https://pyronome.com). With the help of the organizations, you can create different pattern directories that can be accessed via the domain name [https://pyronome.com](https://pyronome.com).

Additionally, you can use organizations to classify your projects and patterns. On **"Home"**, **"Projects"** and **"My Patterns"** pages, there is an organization selection menu located on the top right. When an organization is selected, only the records within the selected organization are displayed.
