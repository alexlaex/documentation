Pyronome has an architecture that supports the conversion of software elements (e.g., snippets, code blocks, libraries, packages, etc.) into reusable components. These reusable components are called "PATTERN"s.

Patterns developed by Pyronome users are accessible to other users through the Pyronome Marketplace. More information on the Pyronome Marketplace is available in [Platform Marketplace](/latest/en/docs/platform-marketplace).
