## The Zero Defect Software Concept

From a certain point of view, a software which is not serving the needs of the user can be considered as defected. This can be caused by one or both reasons listed below:

1.  There are coding errors (bugs) within the code of the software.
2.  The real-life system/problem related to the software was poorly or never analyzed, therefore the resulting computer system fails to serve the real-life system.

One should overcome the above issues to get closer to the zero-defect software phenomenon.

The first type of errors are the runtime errors, namely the bugs in the software. At every line of code developed, there is a certain probability of having something wrong. Therefore as the number of lines of code developed for a project/software increases, the probability of having an error also increases. Reducing the number of lines of code developed specifically for a software project reduces the number of errors. Code generators enable the reduction in number of lines of code. Once the initial bugs in the generator are fixed, in unit time the generated code becomes bug-free.

Modo is designed to be well-structured and machine readable, and therefore it is possible to use generators to convert Modo models to different languages. With the help of this feature Modo addresses the runtime errors.

The second type of errors is the design-time errors which are basically the errors that occur when analyzing the systems. The quality of the system analysis is directly related with the experience of the analyzer. However, even for the inexperienced analyzer, the design-time errors can be fixed with trial and error. The trial and error method can only be efficient if the time needed for each trial is affordable. The simple syntax of Modo combined with the rapid code generation, decreases the time needed to try different scenarios. Therefore enabling the trial and error process and addressing also the design-time errors.

## Agile Software Development

Agile Software Development is a set of values and principles that seek ways to develop better software by using approaches that go beyond traditional patterns. Agile Software Development does not rely on certain rules, nor does it propose a specific method, tool, and / or framework. Instead it reveals a software development philosophy. While developing software, the development team takes decisions on many issues and these decisions affect the overall processes of the project. In the whole development process, taking into account the values and principles of Agile Software Development is the basis of this software development philosophy.

According to [Agile Software Development Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/):

Agile Software Development focues on
- **Individuals and interactions** rather than processes and tools,
- **Working software** rather than comprehensive documentation,
- **Customer collaboration** rather than contract negotiation,
- **Responding to change** rather than following a plan.

Although the Agile Software Development approach is proposed as an alternative to the traditional Waterfall approach, both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages. In other words, it is difficult to say that the Agile Software Development approach is superior to the Waterfall approach or vice versa. On the other hand, the Agile Software Development approach, its result-oriented nature, and its search for better ways of software development by going beyond certain patterns have increased its importance among software development approaches in recent years.
