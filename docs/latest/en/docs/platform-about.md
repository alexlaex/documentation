**More than $ 300 billion was spent on software projects in the world in 2016. However, only 33% of these projects were completed. 48% have exceeded time and budget. 19% were never completed. So about $ 60 billion went into the trash.**

**We believe that this significant loss can be avoided.**

In 2012, we found an easier and faster way to develop software. We have successfully implemented our solution in many commercial projects. Then we decided to share this solution with the whole world. So Pyronome was born.

Pyronome is an online platform that allows software developers to develop sustainable and scalable software solutions fast.

Software development aims to solve real-life problems with the help of computer systems. Computer systems have a specific structure and scope according to real-life/social systems. On the other hand, real-life/social systems have a more complex structure, and sometimes their borders cannot be readily determined. In order to support a social system with computer systems, the social system needs to be translated into a language that the computer can understand. In this transformation phase, the social system should be divided into sections with a certain approach. The operations within the specified sections, the users who will perform these operations, the other processes affected by these operations, and the inputs/outputs of these operations should be determined definitely and precisely.

In 2005, [Aykut Aydınlı](https://github.com/aykutaydinli) developed a concept to use in Sanpark projects. This concept is based on the semantic modeling of social systems with the help of a definition language without focusing on the boundaries of the computer systems; in other words, isolating social systems from computer systems. During the modeling phase, if one can model the system with the language, it means she/he can directly convert the model into computer systems. On the other hand, if one cannot model the social system with the language, it means it is hard to convert the model into computer systems. So it proposes a way to test the social system model at the beginning of the analysis phase.

In the very first days, XML was used as the semantic modeling language in the analysis phases. With the help of automatic conversion tools developed, the systems modeled with XML have been successfully converted to working computer systems. It is evident that social systems are dynamic and can change over time, and the old system can become a new system. The new social system could easily be modeled again with the XML language, and the new computer system for the new social system could easily be generated in a very relatively short time.

Until the end of 2007, XML was used as the modeling language. Other languages ​​that can be used instead of the XML language are investigated; however, the other languages found, ​were insufficient to meet the needs or did not offer a more practical solution than XML. After then, it is decided to develop a new modeling language. Thus [Modo](http://modolanguage.org) was born. [Modo](http://modolanguage.org) has a simple syntax and can be easily read and written by people who are not familiar with computer technologies. For two years, [Modo](http://modolanguage.org) has been tested in modeling many real-life systems; In June 2009, [Modo](http://modolanguage.org) language definition was finalized by [Aykut Aydınlı](https://github.com/aykutaydinli) and [Doruk Eker](https://github.com/dorukeker).

A universal method has been developed for source code generators that can convert [Modo](http://modolanguage.org) models into other computer languages. In 2012, with the development of this universal method, the Pyronome platform was officially born. Initially, source code generators directly read [Modo](http://modolanguage.org) and convert them into definitions in the corresponding language. Generators are written for each language separately, and it takes a relatively long time to add new features to these generators. With the method developed in 2012, general definitions were easily converted into applications in different computer languages. These definitions are called "Pattern"s.

In 2014, web-based interfaces were developed for the creation of patterns; without any coding. After 2017, we decided to share this experience with all the developers around the world.
