A significant part of software development can be described as an effort of modeling real-life systems, using the computer systems. Computer systems, which are more static, have structured (explicitly definite) or semi-structured nature. On the other hand real-life systems, which are more dynamic, can be structured, semi-structured or most of the time, unstructured.

In the year 2005, a concept for software development was proposed by Aykut Ayd覺nl覺 to be used for the projects of Sanpark. The main idea of this concept was to isolate the analysis and the design of real-life systems from the boundaries of computer systems. With the help of this isolated analysis, the idle effort of modeling an unstructured real-life system into a computer system is avoided and the resulting computer system serves as a complete solution. Ensuring the computer system is designed for the real-life system; not vice-versa.

The isolated analysis needs a method to model and define the real-life system. First real-life system definition was made using XML in the late 2005. This definition enabled isolated analysis of real-life systems, automated conversion to existing technologies, and initiated real-life system versioning. This first definition syntax was used by Sanpark for two years.

In late 2007, after observing the short-comings of the previous syntax a new language, which does not use the XML syntax anymore, has been constructed for system definition and semantic representation. And there the Modo language was born. There were two main reasons for abandoning the XML syntax:

1.  XML syntax is not easily readable/writable for non-IT professionals and
2.  XML is not sufficient to declare systems' different conditions, modes and states for different time frames and/or conditions. 

Modo's latest shape was given and the language specification was finalized by Aykut Ayd覺nl覺 and Doruk Eker in June, 2009.
